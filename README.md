# AndroidTasker
Project details:

The current app in my eyes is 99% complete and as such I have made it public with the intention to move on to another project and to revisit this one again later when I have found some more bugs or features to add.

This app was made in android studio and was created in order to expand my knowledge in android studio and Java.

Ideas for future updates:
-	Settings reorganisation (UI)
-	Screen refreshing after creating or editing a task.
-	Splash screen animation for completing 100% of the task. 

App info:

The app combines the classic goal-based model of things to do with the seasonal model which is designed to enable a person to be more flexible and not begin to lose steam when they don't reach every goal consistently each day. 

Combining the two is implemented by having the seasonal theme on the main screen with the daily required tasks on the following screen. The tasks are split into two sections morning and daily to help break them down. The tasks screen additionally has (initially) two randomised two hobby options intended to provide suggestions/ideas to help encourage personal growth as well.

Finally, there is a tracker for daily, yesterday and overall progress. This is intended help provide a challenge against what you have previously achieved.

There are settings which can be used to edit, delete and create tasks, along with theme editing, adding and deleting hobbies.
