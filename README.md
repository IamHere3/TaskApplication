# AndroidTasker
Project details:

The current app in my eyes is 99% complete and as such I have made it public with the intention to move on to another project and to revisit this one again later when I have found some more bugs or features to add.

This app was made in android studio and was created in order to expand my knowledge in android studio and Java.

Ideas for future updates:
-	Settings reorganisation (UI)
-	Splash screen animation for completing 100% of the task.

App info:

This is an app made in android studio, which is intended be classic goal-based model which I can use in my life. Additionally it has a seasonal theme (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) on the main page which is intended as a reminer of the current theme. 

The tasks are split into two sections morning and daily to help break them down. The tasks screen additionally has (initially) two randomised hobby options intended to provide suggestions/ideas to help ensure not to be lost in day-to-day life.

There is a tracker for daily, yesterday and overall progress. This is intended help challenge and improve on what was previously achieved.

Setting in the app can be used to edit, delete and create tasks, along with theme editing, adding and deleting hobbies.
